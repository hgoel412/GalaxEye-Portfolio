# 🛰️ Maritime Surveillance Constellation Analysis (GalaxEye-Aligned)

Constellation design and operational analysis for real-time maritime surveillance using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Satellite Constellation Design** - Walker constellations (6, 12, 32 satellites)
- **Coverage Analysis** - EEZ-wide surveillance capability
- **Sensor Integration** - SAR + Optical fusion benefits
- **Port Monitoring** - Critical maritime infrastructure surveillance
- **Metrics-Driven Analysis** - Detection latency, revisit time, coverage percentages

## Quick Start

See `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for the full narrative.
